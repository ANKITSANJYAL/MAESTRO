Let's begin by understanding the basics of Nearest Neighbor Classifiers, focusing on their operation and key terminology. We'll then address the challenges of measuring similarity through distance. Next, we'll explore how expressive this method can be. We'll also see how Nearest Neighbor is implemented in practice using Python. Finally, we'll discuss the characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks of this approach.
