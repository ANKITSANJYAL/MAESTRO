Let's delve into Nearest-Neighbor Classifiers, starting with the basics of how they operate and the terminology involved. We'll then address the challenges in measuring similarity via distance. Next, the expressiveness of the nearest-neighbor approach will be explored, followed by practical implementation using Python. Finally, we'll examine the characteristics, pros, and cons of this classification method.
